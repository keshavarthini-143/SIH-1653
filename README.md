## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

1.AI-Powered Question and Response Evaluation
AI generates tailored questions based on the candidate's expertise and job profile.
NLP analyzes the candidate’s responses for relevance, accuracy, and depth.
AI ensures that both questions and answers align with the candidate's domain knowledge.
This helps maintain an unbiased and structured interview process.

2.Adaptive Interview Flow
The system dynamically adjusts the complexity of questions based on the candidate’s previous answers.
Follow-up questions are generated in real-time to explore deeper insights.
This creates a conversational flow, similar to real-life boardroom discussions.
It ensures a smooth transition from general to technical questions.

3.Automated Scoring and Feedback
AI evaluates both the interviewer’s question relevance and the candidate’s response quality.
It assigns weighted scores based on correctness, depth, and relevance.
A final competency score is calculated from individual question scores.
The system ensures objective and consistent evaluation.

4.Realistic Virtual Boardroom Simulation
The platform simulates a real-life interview setting with audio, video, and interactive Q&A.
It supports both live and recorded interviews for flexibility.
Candidates and experts experience a structured and professional environment.
This enhances the authenticity of the interview experience.

5.Performance Analysis and Continuous Learning
The system generates detailed performance reports with insights and improvement areas.
AI continuously learns from interview data to refine question generation and evaluation.
Performance benchmarking helps identify gaps and strengths.
The model improves over time, making future evaluations more accurate.
